# The Topos of Graphs

An experiment exploring the topos of graphs and it's internal language using agda.

- The prelude is modified from Jon Sterling's [agda-stc](https://github.com/jonsterling/agda-stc/tree/main) repository. Which is a project using the internal language of certain glued topoi to prove metatheoretic results about the syntax of type theories.
